# ü´Ä Heart Disease Risk Analysis

Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of death globally. This project leverages data science to analyze heart disease risk factors, aiming to enhance public health. This project explores patterns and associations among lifestyle factors and health metrics to understand their role in heart disease risk. This study uncovers insightful trends related to heart disease. While correlation does not imply causation, the findings highlight how certain factors interact, paving the way for early intervention and public education on heart health.

## Using real-world datasets from:

1) [The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), futher operated by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) & The World Health Organization (WHO)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alphiree/cardiovascular-diseases-risk-prediction-dataset?select=CVD_cleaned.csv).
   
2) [University of California at Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning Repository (Cleveland‚Äôs Database)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease).

# Dataset 1 (BRFSS):

## üßπ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

The BRFSS dataset was cleaned and preprocessed using R with the following steps:

‚Ä¢ **Diabetes Reclassification:** Simplified the "Diabetes" column to "Yes" or "No."

‚Ä¢ **Patient Indexing:** Added "Patient_ID" for consistent tracking.

‚Ä¢ **Binary Conversion:** Recoded binary variables (Yes/No) to numerical (1/0).

‚Ä¢ **Standardized Consumption:** Converted all intake values to a monthly scale.

‚Ä¢ **Categorical Factors** Recoded variables like "General_Health" and "Age_Category" as ordered factors.

‚Ä¢ **BMI Categorization:** Grouped BMI into categories: Underweight, Normal, Overweight, and Obesity.

## üìä Summary of Descriptive Statistics

‚Ä¢ Body Metrics: Heights range from 91 to 241 cm, weights from 25 to 293 kg, and BMI from 12.02 to 99.33, suggesting potential outliers and a prevalence of overweight individuals.

‚Ä¢ Dietary Habits: Alcohol, fruit, and vegetable consumption vary widely, with higher intake in fruits and green vegetables.

‚Ä¢ Health Conditions: Most individuals report no heart disease (91.92%) and exercise regularly. Positive responses for conditions like CVD, Diabetes, and Cancer are less common.

‚Ä¢ Demographics: Majority are female, aged 65-69, exercise, have had a recent checkup, and describe their health as "Very Good."

## üîç Correlation Insights

‚Ä¢ BMI & Weight: Strong positive correlation (0.86), as expected, with both showing weak positive correlations with heart disease.

‚Ä¢ Age & Heart Disease: Moderate positive correlation (0.23), indicating an increased likelihood of heart disease with age.

‚Ä¢ Age & Other Conditions: Positive correlations with arthritis (0.37), other cancer (0.20), and diabetes (0.17), common in older individuals.

‚Ä¢ Checkups & Health: Regular checkups correlate positively (0.16) with better general health.

‚Ä¢ General Health & Heart Disease: Moderate negative correlation (-0.26), suggesting poorer health is linked to higher heart disease risk.

‚Ä¢ Exercise & Heart Disease: Negative correlation (-0.10), indicating regular exercise may reduce heart disease risk.
