# ðŸ«€ Heart Disease Risk Analysis

Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of death globally. This project leverages data science to analyze heart disease risk factors, aiming to enhance public health. This project explores patterns and associations among lifestyle factors and health metrics to understand their role in heart disease risk. This study uncovers insightful trends related to heart disease. While correlation does not imply causation, the findings highlight how certain factors interact, paving the way for early intervention and public education on heart health.
