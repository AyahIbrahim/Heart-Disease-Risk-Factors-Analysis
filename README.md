# ü´Ä Heart Disease Risk Analysis

Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of death globally. his project explores patterns and associations among lifestyle factors and health metrics to understand their role in heart disease risk and uncover insightful trends. While correlation does not imply causation, the findings highlight how certain factors interact, paving the way for early intervention and public education on heart health.

## Using real-world datasets from:

1) [The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), futher operated by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) & The World Health Organization (WHO)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alphiree/cardiovascular-diseases-risk-prediction-dataset?select=CVD_cleaned.csv).
   
2) [University of California at Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning Repository (Cleveland‚Äôs Database)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease).

# Dataset 1 (BRFSS):

## üßπ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

The BRFSS dataset was cleaned and preprocessed using R with the following steps:

‚Ä¢ **Diabetes Reclassification:** Simplified the "Diabetes" column to "Yes" or "No."

‚Ä¢ **Patient Indexing:** Added "Patient_ID" for consistent tracking.

‚Ä¢ **Binary Conversion:** Recoded binary variables (Yes/No) to numerical (1/0).

‚Ä¢ **Standardized Consumption:** Converted all intake values to a monthly scale.

‚Ä¢ **Categorical Factors** Recoded variables like "General_Health" and "Age_Category" as ordered factors.

‚Ä¢ **BMI Categorization:** Grouped BMI into categories: Underweight, Normal, Overweight, and Obesity.

## üîç Correlation Insights

‚Ä¢ BMI & Weight: Strong positive correlation (0.86), as expected, with both showing weak positive correlations with heart disease.

‚Ä¢ Age & Heart Disease: Moderate positive correlation (0.23), indicating an increased likelihood of heart disease with age.

‚Ä¢ Age & Other Conditions: Positive correlations with arthritis (0.37), other cancer (0.20), and diabetes (0.17), common in older individuals.

‚Ä¢ Checkups & Health: Regular checkups correlate positively (0.16) with better general health.

‚Ä¢ General Health & Heart Disease: Moderate negative correlation (-0.26), suggesting poorer health is linked to higher heart disease risk.

‚Ä¢ Exercise & Heart Disease: Negative correlation (-0.10), indicating regular exercise may reduce heart disease risk.

## Below are some of the most important visuals created using Tableau that helped me derive valuable insights:

‚Ä¢ **Age & Heart Disease Risk:**

## üìà Statistical Significance Analysis

‚Ä¢ **Chi-Square Test:** Found significant associations between heart disease and variables like age, general health, exercise habits, smoking history, and gender based on p-values.

‚Ä¢ **ANOVA Test:** Showed significant differences in how age, general health, and checkup frequency influence BMI, indirectly affecting heart disease risk.
