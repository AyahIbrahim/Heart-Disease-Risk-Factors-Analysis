# ü´Ä Heart Disease Risk Analysis

Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of death globally. his project explores patterns and associations among lifestyle factors and health metrics to understand their role in heart disease risk and uncover insightful trends. While correlation does not imply causation, the findings highlight how certain factors interact, paving the way for early intervention and public education on heart health.

## Using real-world datasets from:

1) [The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), futher operated by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) & The World Health Organization (WHO)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alphiree/cardiovascular-diseases-risk-prediction-dataset?select=CVD_cleaned.csv).
   
2) [University of California at Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning Repository (Cleveland‚Äôs Database)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease).

# Dataset 1 (BRFSS): 

This dataset includes a lot of variables that seem to play a critical role in influencing the development of CVD. These include various factors such as general health, checkup frequency, BMI, physical activity, presence of other disease or mental health disorders, smoking history, alcohol consumption, and other dietary variables, including even demographic variables such as age, height, and gender.

## üßπ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

The BRFSS dataset was cleaned and preprocessed using R with the following steps:

‚Ä¢ **Diabetes Reclassification:** Simplified the "Diabetes" column to "Yes" or "No."

‚Ä¢ **Patient Indexing:** Added "Patient_ID" for consistent tracking.

‚Ä¢ **Binary Conversion:** Recoded binary variables (Yes/No) to numerical (1/0).

‚Ä¢ **Standardized Consumption:** Converted all intake values to a monthly scale.

‚Ä¢ **Categorical Factors** Recoded variables like "General_Health" and "Age_Category" as ordered factors.

‚Ä¢ **BMI Categorization:** Grouped BMI into categories: Underweight, Normal, Overweight, and Obesity.

## üîç Correlation Insights

‚Ä¢ BMI & Weight: Strong positive correlation (0.86), as expected, with both showing weak positive correlations with heart disease.

‚Ä¢ Age & Heart Disease: Moderate positive correlation (0.23), indicating an increased likelihood of heart disease with age.

‚Ä¢ Age & Other Conditions: Positive correlations with arthritis (0.37), other cancer (0.20), and diabetes (0.17), common in older individuals.

‚Ä¢ Checkups & Health: Regular checkups correlate positively (0.16) with better general health.

‚Ä¢ General Health & Heart Disease: Moderate negative correlation (-0.26), suggesting poorer health is linked to higher heart disease risk.

‚Ä¢ Exercise & Heart Disease: Negative correlation (-0.10), indicating regular exercise may reduce heart disease risk.

## üßπ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

‚Ä¢ Imputation of missing (NA) values with the mean. 

‚Ä¢ Modified the features names to terms that are easier and more clear for the general public to grasp using R programming.

I found the insights below to be useful:

‚Ä¢ Maximum Heart Rate Achieved has a negative correlation (-0.42) with heart disease, indicating that a higher maximum heart rate achieved is associated with a lower likelihood of heart disease.

‚Ä¢ Exercise ST segment Depression Value shows a moderate positive correlation (0.50) with heart disease, meaning that higher ST segment depression is associated with a higher likelihood of heart disease.

‚Ä¢ Slope Peak Exercise ST segment Value and Unblocked Coronary Arteries also show positive correlations (0.38 and 0.52, respectively) with heart disease.

‚Ä¢ Unblocked Coronary Arteries have a strong positive correlation (0.36) with age, indicating that older participants tend to have more unblocked coronary arteries.

‚Ä¢ Aging also seems to lead to higher cholestrol, bloos pressure, and sugar levels.

‚Ä¢ Thalassemia Type shows strong positive correlations with Chest Pain Type (0.26) and Unblocked Coronary Arteries (0.29), suggesting some association between these conditions.
